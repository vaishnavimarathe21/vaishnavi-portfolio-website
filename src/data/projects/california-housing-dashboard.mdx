# California Housing Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced, interactive dashboard for California housing price prediction using linear regression and its variants. It features a Streamlit web app with rich visualizations, model comparison, feature engineering, and explainability.

## Key Features

### Multiple Regression Models
- **Linear Regression** - Basic linear model for baseline predictions
- **Polynomial Regression** - Captures non-linear relationships
- **Ridge Regression** - L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Lasso Regression** - L1 regularization with feature selection

### Advanced Visualizations
- **Geospatial Maps** - Interactive maps showing predictions and errors across California
- **Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)** - Shows how individual features affect predictions
- **Feature Importance** - Coefficient analysis and SHAP explanations
- **Residuals Analysis** - Loss curves and correlation heatmaps

### User Experience
- **Downloadable Predictions** - Export model results and coefficients
- **Custom Data Upload** - Upload your own data for predictions
- **Live Model Comparison** - Side-by-side model performance comparison
- **Modern UI** - Glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Feature Engineering** - Region clustering and interaction terms
- **Outlier Removal** - Statistical methods for data cleaning
- **Data Validation** - Input validation and error handling

### Model Performance
